# VGS-interview
ReadMe info:

As I stated on the initial Interview, I can read code and understand it, but my coding skills are a bit rusty. 
I couldn't get everything to work properly, but I have implemented the code in my own test document.

Based on my testing, I don't think anything special is needed in the .env file
